C
C=F=   IMOTTWG          = 0 - simulate events without a weight.
C                           The Mott cross-section is approximated with an exponential 
C                           A substitution theta=-log(x)/alpha, or x=exp(-alpha*theta) is made.
C                           The Mott cross-section on the variable x is stored in the histograms.
C                           Events are simulated using HRNDM1

C                           and assign a weight to the event (cross-section on x) 
C                       = 1 - "heavy" weights: even distribution in theta and the cross-section
C                              used for weight. These weights differ by many orders of magnitude.
